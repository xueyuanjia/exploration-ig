        is to provide W3C Members with a forum to explore and discuss emerging web-related technology trends

        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>
          The W3C Process indicates that a role of the Advisory Board is to provide strategic guidance
          to the W3C. Analogous to Process Document management, the Advisory Board recognized that there
          is interest among the broader Membership for these discussions and encouraged the creation of a
          dedicated Interest Group for ongoing strategic conversations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is to provide a platform to help W3C (including the W3C team) investigating emerging
          technology trends, analyzing their impacts on the evolution of Web technologies, and proposing
          ways for W3C to collaborate shaping the trends for the benefit of the Web users.
        </p>
      </div>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Monitor industry and technology trends and analyze their potential impact on the Web.
          </li>
          <li>
            Based on these findings, develop strategic narratives to help the W3C community
            understand these trends, the relevance of W3C activities, or a gap analysis where
            there are no current W3C activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide a forum for members of the W3C community (including the W3C team) to share
            updates with the Membership as part of broader strategic discussions (e.g., <a href='https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/97/views/1'>Strategy
            Team's Incubation Pipeline updates</a>, <a href='https://www.w3.org/liaisons/'>liaison updates</a>, <a href='https://www.w3.org/community/'>Community Group updates</a>). This
            is intended to complement other venues for updates, including both Member-focused discussions
            (e.g., AC meeting or AB-led Member meeting) and broader community discussions (e.g., TPAC breakouts).
            The value proposition of this Interest Group is to support deeper ongoing strategic conversations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide a forum for members of the W3C community (including the W3C team) to seek in-depth
            strategic input from the W3C Membership. Examples of who might seek strategic guidance from
            the Interest Group: Community Groups considering transitioning to a Working Group; parties who
            seek help resolving strategic issues related to a charter in development (as opposed to issues
            for which another group such as the TAG would be more appropriate).

          <li>
            These reports would be informative only and could be reviewed by the W3C community, and where there appears to be consensus, published as

    <p>
      Reports published by the IG inform strategic conversations within W3C, leading to visible activities
      such as new Community Groups, improvements or greater consensus around draft Working Group charters,
      W3C Workshops, AC meeting agenda items, TPAC breakout sessions, structured email discussions within
      the broader Membership, and productive liaisons.

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Interest Group is expected to have 6 or
          more active participants for its duration. The Chairs
          are expected to contribute a quarter of a working day per week
          towards the Interest Group. There is no minimum requirement for
          other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute through its public communication channels.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public">
          Discussions for this Interest Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/exploration/">Exploration Interest Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Exploration Interest Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its work on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/exploration-ig/">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As this group is exploratory, the group will:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>gather information, ensuring that all sides of controversial ideas (e.g. blockchain tech, the potential benefits and perils of AI) are considered,</li>
          <li>seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">consensus</a> on matters of fact, and <em>if possible</em> on matters of prediction/prescription,</li>
          <li>publish reports recording the various positions, and may record the rough division of opinions in the group across those positions.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. Group participants
          have a <span id='cfc'>one week</span> period to comment on provisional resolutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.

          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

        <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to

          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/patent-policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
            6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
          Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
